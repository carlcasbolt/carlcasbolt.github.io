                        knowledge of Symfony and ElasticSearch on physical machines and AWS cloud
                        environments. High attention to detail with all the code I write as well as a
                        TDD and BDD advocate as tests before code mean you can have a high confidence
                        your code will work when it gets out to the user. This is enhanced by my love
                        for CI and automated tests running before every merge is acceptable. Also a
                        skilled SRE with an active interest in Kubernetes and IAC, because managing 100
                        servers by hand was never a fun job, even at the best of times.

                                    Initially worked on the new version 2 of the API system built using DDD
                                    with Symfony as a toolbox. Primarily responsible for docker configuration
                                    used on local development and shell scripts to get the code working in
                                    ECS.
                                </li>

                                    Built a new set of clients to talk to third parties via REST and SOAP
                                    using the HttpClient and SOAP libraries available in Symfony5 and PHP8
                                    Code quality tools include PHPUnit, Behat, CodeSnigger and PHPStan. All
                                    run on github workflows when Pull Requests were opened.

                                    The later half of my time with Journey was spent improving the DevOps
                                    tool chain and assisted on the migration from ECS to K8s on EKS using
                                    helm charts.

                                    processing was done in Symfony before generating a REST response for consumption by

                                Carl is a highly skilled developer and his breadth of knowledge across disciplines
                                is envious. His contributions to the DevOps team at Journey have been invaluable
                                and it's been a pleasure to gain an insight into his experience and absorb a
                                fraction of his knowledge in this field. He is meticulous, methodical and his
                                attention to detail is matched by very few I have worked with in the past. Carl
                                is a true asset to any client/business and I do hope our paths cross again in the
                                not to distant future.

                                His depth of knowledge is astounding. Combined with his tight grasp on supporting
                                technologies, he is the quintessential Symfony developer.

                                Carl is an exceptional developer. His attention to detail is almost unmatched in
                                any developer I have worked with. His passion for technology shines through in the
                                quality of his work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Carl is an enthusiastic advocate of open source technologies, and regularly attends
                                meetups and conferences to keep his knowledge up to date. He is also helping to
                                maintain my Elasticsearch client library on Github, a subject he has extensive
                                knowledge in.

                                Always willing to go the extra distance to deliver robust, scalable and maintainable
                                code, Carl is a developer I would happily work with again.

                                I worked with Carl on a brief, time sensitive project to deliver the MVP of a product.
                                Even though it was completed in time, below budget and above spec it still had ~90%
                                code testing coverage, behaviour driven testing and full continuous integration. Carl
                                has very high attention to detail, drive and determination to complete set tasks and
                                an in depth technical knowledge. I learned a lot from Carl in the short time we worked
                                together. I'd have no hesitation in recommending Carl to anyone considering taking him on.

                                Carl rapidly became a cornerstone of the engineering team at Rightster. His expertise
                                and experience within software and infrastructure development, and their associated best
                                practices, was instrumental in the success of the strong engineering team that Carl helped
                                to build at Rightster. Carl was always eager to learn new skills and continuously expanded
                                his skillset to include technical leadership, infrastructure-as-code, search and
                                distributed cloud-based software architecture.

                                Carl is possessed with hawk-like attention to detail, and has a knack of discovering the
                                logic holes and security flaws that most others tend to miss. He's a great technologist
                                and a huge asset to any team lucky enough to have him.
